                    Dear Parents, Guardians, and Students of St. James Middle School, <br /><br />
            
                    In light of recent events, we are deeply saddened and concerned by the news that three students from our school community have been reported missing. 
                    This is a difficult time for us all, and our hearts go out to the families of 
                    Anne Boonchuy, Sasha Waybright, and Marcy Wu. <br /><br />
            
                    We recognize that this situation may be causing a range of emotions among our students. 
                    To provide support, our school counselor, Dr. Penelope, 
                    will be available to speak with any students who may need a listening ear or a safe space to process their feelings. 
                    She is available during school hours and can be reached at the main office or by appointment. <br /><br />
            
                    We encourage parents and guardians to talk openly with their children about any concerns they may have and to reach out if additional support is needed. Keeping our students safe, informed, and supported remains our utmost priority. Teachers and staff are also here to help, and we are committed to fostering an environment of compassion and understanding. <br /><br />
            
                    If you have any questions or need further assistance, please do not hesitate to contact our administration. <br /><br />
            
                    Sincerely, <br />
                    Principal Kim Murphy, St. James Middle School <br />
