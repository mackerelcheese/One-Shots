    <p>The days after the full moon tend to be some of the loneliest. </p>
    <p>The dormitory feels frozen in time - James’ socks are strewn over his bed as if he was in a rush, Peter’s quill is half-hidden under some parchment where he likely dropped his bag before leaving, and Sirius’ sheets are in a tangled pile at the end of the bed where he definitely rolled out of bed that morning. It’s quiet, like the aftermath of a hurricane. </p>
    <p>Remus cannot stand their hovering, their kindness often suffocating - which is why he chases them away with false assurances, begging them to leave him alone in the days after the moon. And yet, he cannot shake the lonely feeling in his bones today. </p>
    <p>The slight ache in Remus’ joints doesn’t hurt enough to force him into bed but is uncomfortable enough to make walking a chore. A part of him wants to sleep the day away but it feels like a waste of a Sunday. He has already lost so much time to his condition - he wasn’t going to waste even more time. No one else was in the dorms when he woke up from his nap. As far as he knew, none of his friends had any plans today. It would take him forever to hunt for them through the castle. </p>
    <p>Unless… </p>
    <p>Remus pulls out the blank parchment from his nightstand where they stashed it after a long night of fiddling with the spellwork. The innocuous piece of paper was so much more than what meets the eye - the beginnings of their latest project, a map of the school. </p>
    <p>The map is their magnum opus, the pinnacle of their time at the school, Remus is sure of it. It is by no means perfect or complete, but Remus can’t help but feel slightly impressed with it already. His heart feels giddy just thinking about all the things they could do once they finally map out the rest of the school and perfect the homunculus charm. He could use this to find his friends (well if they were in the places <em>they did </em>map out). What better way to test their creation than diving headfirst into it?  </p>
    <p>He taps the parchment with his wand. </p>

<!--Library-->

<div class="library-story">
    <p>The library was one of Remus’ favourite places in the entire castle - a quiet reprieve from the hectic hallways and crowded classrooms. Not many students are willing to spend their Sundays in the library but Lily has always liked being the exception to the rules. </p>
    <p>In some ways, Lily was the only other person who understood Remus’ need to prove himself - the muggleborn and the werewolf. Neither are seen as equals to the rest of wizardkind and yet, they persist. But not without tremendous amounts of effort on their end - having to work twice as hard for a fraction of the credit, the acknowledgement, and the benefit, unlike the rest of their peers. </p>
    <p>Lily is not the kind of person to let something as trivial as blood status stop her from becoming the brightest witch of their generation, even if it meant losing a few Sundays here and there. </p>
    <p>“The rest of the circus isn’t with you?” she looks up from her book and raises an eyebrow at him. </p>
    <p>Remus slides into the seat across from her, “I don’t actually know if they have even seen the inside of the library since the beginning of term.” </p>
    <p>“Sounds about right”, Lily gives a little snort, dipping her quill in the inkpot. “How’s your charms essay coming along?” Remus hums, pulling out his half-complete essay. </p>
    <p>Time passes like molasses bent over parchments and textbooks. After a while, his head begins to throb and his wrists begin to freeze. “We should probably take a break,” Lily says, wincing at the loud audible cracks from Remus rotating his wrist joints. “We can go back to the common room?” </p>
    <p>Remus looks down at the work splayed out in front of her and chews on the inside of his cheek. His head feels awful and begging for him to be horizontal right now. Remus gives her a small smile. He does like spending time with her, but reading and writing will likely only make his head worse and worry her. </p>
    <p>“It’s alright, I can go on my own,” Remus says rubbing the back of his neck. “Should probably find the others anyway.” </p>
    <p>Lily studies his face as if trying to catch his lie but she nods anyway. “I’ll meet up with you later?” she asks quietly. “We can go compare our notes then.” </p>
    <p>They bid each other farewell and Remus makes his way out. Stopping outside the library exit, Remus pulls out the map again.</p>
