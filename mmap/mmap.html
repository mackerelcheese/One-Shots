    <h3>Summary:</h3>
    <blockquote>
        <p>As far as he knew, none of his friends had any plans today. It would take him forever to hunt for them through the castle. </p>
        <p>Unless… </p>
        <p>Remus pulls out the blank parchment from his nightstand where they stashed it after a long night of fiddling with the spellwork. The innocuous piece of paper was so much more than what meets the eye - the beginnings of their latest project, a map of the school. </p>
    </blockquote>
        
    <p>Or: Remus is lonely and tests out their new map to look for his friends.</p> 
    <p>Or, or: The proof of concept for a prototype interactive Marauders Map workskin I’m making poorly disguised as a Choose Your Own Adventure fluff fic. Click away, my friends.</p>

            <summary><strong><u>Are you sure?</u></strong></summary>
        
        <p>Okay, I’m trusting you.</p>
        <p>I don’t smoke but i need a cigarette after all that math. To think that I didn't know HTML a few months ago smh.</p> 
        <p>Also!! The marauders map!! So hard to translate into HTML because what do you mean it folds out like that??? Accordion core for real. My brain isnt big enough for that now,,, but i will get there one day,,, </p>
        <p>This is the first rendition of a choose your own adventure (cyoa) format i’m experimenting with! I want you (the reader) to feel as if you are “building” the fic as you make the choices. I’ve never been to build-a-bear but I assume this is what it's like.</p> 
        <p>I’m also considering writing a tutorial for this but it's too much math… Maybe I can do a simpler one with the interactive buttons but the cyoa has to be a different tutorial altogether. I would like to thank flexboxes and order for making this possible.</p> 
        <p>Notes for future versions:</p> 
        
        <ul>
            <li>Make it so that it can fold out to make a bigger map (and figure out how that would work on mobile)</li> 
            <li>Learn calligraphy to make a better background T.T</li>
        </ul>
