    <p>The days after the full moon tend to be some of the loneliest. </p>
    <p>The dormitory feels frozen in time - James’ socks are strewn over his bed as if he was in a rush, Peter’s quill is half-hidden under some parchment where he likely dropped his bag before leaving, and Sirius’ sheets are in a tangled pile at the end of the bed where he definitely rolled out of bed that morning. It’s quiet, like the aftermath of a hurricane. </p>
    <p>Remus cannot stand their hovering, their kindness often suffocating - which is why he chases them away with false assurances, begging them to leave him alone in the days after the moon. And yet, he cannot shake the lonely feeling in his bones today. </p>
    <p>The slight ache in Remus’ joints doesn’t hurt enough to force him into bed but is uncomfortable enough to make walking a chore. A part of him wants to sleep the day away but it feels like a waste of a Sunday. He has already lost so much time to his condition - he wasn’t going to waste even more time. No one else was in the dorms when he woke up from his nap. As far as he knew, none of his friends had any plans today. It would take him forever to hunt for them through the castle. </p>
    <p>Unless… </p>
    <p>Remus pulls out the blank parchment from his nightstand where they stashed it after a long night of fiddling with the spellwork. The innocuous piece of paper was so much more than what meets the eye - the beginnings of their latest project, a map of the school. </p>
    <p>The map is their magnum opus, the pinnacle of their time at the school, Remus is sure of it. It is by no means perfect or complete, but Remus can’t help but feel slightly impressed with it already. His heart feels giddy just thinking about all the things they could do once they finally map out the rest of the school and perfect the homunculus charm. He could use this to find his friends (well if they were in the places <em>they did </em>map out). What better way to test their creation than diving headfirst into it?  </p>
    <p>He taps the parchment with his wand. </p>

        <p>The library was one of Remus’ favourite places in the entire castle - a quiet reprieve from the hectic hallways and crowded classrooms. Not many students are willing to spend their Sundays in the library but Lily has always liked being the exception to the rules. </p>
        <p>In some ways, Lily was the only other person who understood Remus’ need to prove himself - the muggleborn and the werewolf. Neither are seen as equals to the rest of wizardkind and yet, they persist. But not without tremendous amounts of effort on their end - having to work twice as hard for a fraction of the credit, the acknowledgement, and the benefit, unlike the rest of their peers. </p>
        <p>Lily is not the kind of person to let something as trivial as blood status stop her from becoming the brightest witch of their generation, even if it meant losing a few Sundays here and there. </p>
        <p>“The rest of the circus isn’t with you?” she looks up from her book and raises an eyebrow at him. </p>
        <p>Remus slides into the seat across from her, “I don’t actually know if they have even seen the inside of the library since the beginning of term.” </p>
        <p>“Sounds about right”, Lily gives a little snort, dipping her quill in the inkpot. “How’s your charms essay coming along?” Remus hums, pulling out his half-complete essay. </p>
        <p>Time passes like molasses bent over parchments and textbooks. After a while, his head begins to throb and his wrists begin to freeze. “We should probably take a break,” Lily says, wincing at the loud audible cracks from Remus rotating his wrist joints. “We can go back to the common room?” </p>
        <p>Remus looks down at the work splayed out in front of her and chews on the inside of his cheek. His head feels awful and begging for him to be horizontal right now. Remus gives her a small smile. He does like spending time with her, but reading and writing will likely only make his head worse and worry her. </p>
        <p>“It’s alright, I can go on my own,” Remus says rubbing the back of his neck. “Should probably find the others anyway.” </p>
        <p>Lily studies his face as if trying to catch his lie but she nods anyway. “I’ll meet up with you later?” she asks quietly. “We can go compare our notes then.” </p>
        <p>They bid each other farewell and Remus makes his way out. Stopping outside the library exit, Remus pulls out the map again.</p>

    <div class="great-story">
        <hr>
        <p>The Great Hall is surprisingly filled with chatter on a Sunday afternoon. But Remus spots Peter at the end of the Gryffindor table with ease. He’s deep in focus with his beloved chess set in between him and Marlene. </p>
        <p>Remus slides into the seat beside Marlene as one of her knights gets smashed by Peter’s queen and swept off the board. Judging by the small pile of broken white pieces, Peter seems to be beating Marlene with brutal efficiency. </p>
        <p>“Ugh, I don’t know why I agreed to this,” Marlene sighs as one of her pawns gets sacrificed. Peter, that bastard, just smiles at her as he finally whispers, “Check.” </p>
        <p>Marlene drops her head onto the table with a loud thump and groans, “Why am I playing this?” </p>
        <p>“Come on,” Peter chuckles as he reset the board. “Do you want to beat Meadows or not?” </p>
        <p>She lifts her head and cries out, “How am I supposed to learn anything if you keep beating me so quickly?” </p>
        <p>“Remus, save me,” she says turning towards him instead. </p>
        <p>“I’ve never won against Peter since second year,” Remus replies raising his eyebrow. </p>
        <p>“But you can hold on your own for more than two minutes right?” she retorts. “That’s longer than I have and maybe I can <em>actually see</em> what works.”  </p>
        <p>She slides down the bench to give him room as Peter resets the board. Now mended once more, the pieces sit still waiting for the next instruction. </p>
        <p>“Go easy on a fella would ya?” Remus asks knowing that there’s nothing Peter hates more. </p>
        <p>Peter laughs, “Not a fat chance in hell.” Marlene lets out a groan and the game finally begins.   </p>
        <p><em>Alright then.</em> “Pawn to E4,” Remus orders. </p>
        <p>The thing Remus loves about Peter is the fact that he never treated Remus differently after the initial shock of his furry little problem faded. It took Remus shouting at James and Sirius to get them to stop treating him like he was extra fragile. But Peter refused to let the knowledge of Remus being a werewolf stop him from treating him the same as before - including beating him thoroughly at chess.  </p>
        <p>The game is longer than Marlene’s as the piles of black and white broken pieces grow steadily on each side. The aching feeling in Remus’ temples comes back as the hall begins to fill with more first and second-years goofing around with their new knowledge of levitation charms and tiny sparklers. </p>
        <p>Remus almost misses Peter calling out checkmate after trapping his king from all sides when a Ravenclaw student accidentally explodes the feather they were practising on. </p>
        <p>Remus’ eyes hurt and despite everything, his body just wants to go back to bed. Remus clenches his jaw to try and stave off the pain. It isn't fair that his body is so tired for days after the moon. It wasn’t bad enough that he had to transform every month, but he also has to deal with the side effects for days before and after. </p>
        <p>“Are you alright there Remus?” Marlene asks concernly. </p>
        <p>Remus forces a smile, “Yeah, just a little loud here.” </p>
        <p>“We can move to the common room,” Peter suggests. “No need for us to be here.” </p>
        <p>“It’s alright, you can stay here. I’ll head off,” Remus waves them off, grabbing his bag and standing up. “Good luck Marls.” </p>
        <p>Standing in the corridor outside of the Great Hall, Remus pulls out the map again. </p>

        <p>Remus doesn’t know what he expected when he decided to look for James in the kitchens - but it certainly wasn’t this. </p>
        <p>“You’re baking?” Remus asks incredulously. </p>
        <p>“Moony!” James says, eyes wide, hands stuck in a literal (empty) cookie jar. “What are you doing here?” </p>
        <p>“Looking for you,” Remus replies opening his bag slightly to show James the map in his bag. “What are <em>you</em> doing here?</p>
        <p>“Guess my secrets out in the open now,” James playfully huffs before pointing to the house elf next to him. “Minsley here is teaching me how to bake cookies in exchange for reading lessons.” </p>
        <p>Minsleys ears flap with pride as James recounts her achievements with Babbiyty Rabbitty and The Fountain of Fair Fortune. Remus takes a seat at the table, peering into the mixing bowl where James pours an incredible amount of chocolate chips into. He gives it a good mix before handing Remus the chocolate-covered spoon with a wink.  </p>
        <p>“Why do you want to learn to bake anyway?” Remus says taking the spoon and giving it a good lick. “Your mum would love to teach you.” </p>
        <p>Remus hums around the spoon. Remus never could quite figure James out even though he has his heart on his sleeve. Most people who think they know James would assume that he has his head stuck in Quidditch, but he is so much more than that. Because <em>of course,</em> he is the kind of person to exchange reading lessons with a house elf to learn to bake his cookies for his mother. He is the kind of person who would learn anything and push boundaries for someone he loves. </p>
        <p>“But why reading lessons?” Remus asks curiously.</p>
        <p>“It doesn’t cost much to be kind,” James grins, his dimple poking through. “Plus it’s always good to have the house elves on our side.” </p>
        <p>Remus rolls his eyes sarcastically and points the spoon at him, “Of course that is your goal.” </p>
        <p>James can only laugh as he continues to fold the chocolate chips into the batter. At some point, Minsley pours them both a cup of tea as the boys chat about nearly everything and anything. The kitchens are warm and remind him of home with his Ma. </p>
        <p>By the time the cups are empty, James is scooping the last bits of the batter into tiny balls on the baking tray.  </p>
        <p>Remus suddenly yawns, overcome with drowsiness. He can’t help but attempt to rub the sleepiness out of his eyes. </p>
        <p>“You could go back to sleep you know,” James remarks not looking up from the growing neat rows of round chocolate. “No one minds and you’re not going to miss out on much.” </p>
        <p>Being able to go to Hogwarts as a werewolf is a miracle on its own, Remus doesn’t want to have to miss out on anything, even the small quiet moments despite how right James is. </p>
        <p>“We’ll have to wait for about 15 minutes for it to bake and then wait a while more for it to cool,” James continues. “You should take it easy and rest.” </p>
        <p>Remus huffs but nods anyway. He isn’t angry at James, after all, James <em>is</em> right. It doesn’t seem right to stay here if James is going to keep worrying about him anyway. </p>
        <p>He picks up his bag and bids James and Minsley farewell before stepping out of the kitchen. The painting of the bowl of fruit swings shut behind him and Remus opens the map once more. </p>

        <hr>
        <p>The greenhouses are out of the way of the rest of the castle. The lack of students in the area during free periods made this one of the easiest spots for them to map out. </p>
        <p>Remus mentally runs through Sirius’ schedule and can’t find a reason why Sirius would be in the greenhouse. Pushing the metal door open, he spots Sirius among the crowded tables and empty flowerbeds. He’s on his knees poking around at the empty flowerbed with an open book floating next to him.  </p>
        <p>“What are you doing?” Remus asks crouching down next to him. </p>
        <p>Sirius’ hand flies to shut the book, “Merlin, Moony you scared me.” </p>
        <p>They both stand, and Sirius stuffs the book back in his bag. “Just looking at… dirt.” </p>
        <p>“Why would you need dirt?” Remus narrows his eyes at him. </p>
        <p>“Oh you know,” Sirius retorts flippantly. “James and I are thinking of raising an army of mandrakes.” </p>
        <p>“There are probably other ways to prank without making everyone’s ears start bleeding,” Remus leans against the table. “What would you even do with mandrakes anyway?” </p>
        <p>Sirius rubs the back of his neck. “Nothing important,” he rushes out. “Just a little experiment that’s all.” </p>
        <p>Remus raises an eyebrow at him, “What kind of experiment?”</p>
        <p>“The kind where I’m still figuring it out,” Sirius waves his hand dismissively. “You’ll be the first to know once we’ve figured it out Moony.” </p>
        <p>“Fine,” Remus agrees and rolls his eyes.  </p>
        <p>“Brilliant,” Sirius smiles at him. </p>
        <p>Remus’ heart jumps to his throat and he can feel the heat rising to his cheeks. He quickly turns around, not wanting Sirius to see his face and bumps into the table behind him. A pot from a second-year class that was precariously on the edge of the table tips over and smashes into the ground. A mandrake flies out of the earth and begins to scream. </p>
        <p>Sirius and Remus quickly cover their ears as the root begins to wail. Remus grabs one of the earmuffs nearby and pulls it on before scooping the screaming root. He dumps it into the empty flowerbed Sirius was tending to and buries it underneath enough dirt to satiate the mandrake and dampen its cries. </p>
        <p>“We should probably repot that,” Remus says pulling off the earmuffs. </p>
        <p>“Moony!” Sirius cries out pulling on Remus’ hands. “You’re bleeding.” In the tussle, Remus didn’t even notice when the shards of the broken pot cut into his skin. The cuts are superficial and barely hurt but he lets Sirius drag him towards the nearby sink. He can’t help hiss at the sudden sting as the cool water washes the dirt out. </p>
        <p>Sirius eyebrows furrow as he gently pulls Remus’ hand closer. “<em>Episkey</em>,” Sirius murmurs with his wand aimed at the wound and the small cuts begin to stitch itself back together. </p>
        <p>Sirius breaks out in a large smile and runs the pad of his thumb over the unbroken skin. “I’ve been practising my healing spells.” </p>
        <p>Sirius usually looks indifferent when he aces his spellwork in class as if it was second nature to him.  To see Sirius so happy when his healing spell worked on Remus makes his chest feel incredibly warm.</p>
        <p>“I need to go,” Remus manages to stammer out and pulls his hand out of Sirius’. </p>
        <p>“Remus, wait -” </p>
        <p>Remus’s heart wants to break out of his chest as he leaves the greenhouse. He tries to ignore Sirius’ name pacing the small area of the map and figures out where he should go next.  </p>

        <p>The Gryffindor common room is uncharacteristically quiet - it would make sense that most of the students would be taking advantage of the nice weather to be around the castle grounds. </p>
        <p>As much as he wanted to go around the castle to just do <em>something</em>, Remus’ body was on the brink of giving up for today. </p>
        <p>He pulls out the map from his bag and watches as the little banners with his friends’ names wander around the castle. He has to force his eyelids to stay open and he begins to sink into the plush cushions on the sofa by the fireplace. It was comforting to know that if he couldn’t physically be by their side, at least he could watch them from afar. </p>
        <hr> 
        <p>The Fat Lady’s portrait swings open and Remus’ friends spill into the room. Their hands are full of parchments, chess sets, cookies, and flowers - all wanting to show Remus their bounty of the day. Their chatterings stop as they notice Remus curled up by the fireplace, his mouth slightly agape.  </p>
        <p>“That has to be an uncomfortable angle,” Peter says wincing at the way Remus’ chin was tucked into his chest. Sirius hands him the flowers wrapped in wax paper and rearranges Remus into a more comfortable position that does not promise a sore back when he wakes up.  </p>
        <p>As Lily went to fetch a spare blanket from her dorm, James set the cookies down on the nearby table recasting the stasis charm. Peter sets up another round of chess beside the plate, ready to get another victim to play with. They all could spend the day away from each other but they come back - they always will. </p>
        <p>“Ah, so that’s where that is,” Sirius picks up the map that fell out of Remus’ grasp and onto the floor. All the name banners that they have managed to display on the map are all huddled together, bumping into each other. </p>
        <p>He taps it with his wand, “Mischief managed.” </p>
