<p>“What do you think happens when we die?” </p>
<p>The roof of the mansion is still wet from the rain but Regulus does not care. Its probably a bad spot for Regulus to lie down on but it's not everyday you get kicked out of your mother’s funeral. It was foolish of him to think that his father would have let him attend. A small part of him wishes that his mother could have seen past his [queerness and see him for him]. An even smaller part knows they never would. </p>
<p>He knows his parents’ aren’t good people. Once they realised that he was following in Sirius’ footsteps, they didn’t even give him the chance to leave them. They’re his parents. Why couldn’t he let them go as easily as they left him? They tossed him out at the first opportunity, leaving him loveless and penniless. </p>
<p>Despite everything, he isn’t quite loveless, and definitely not penniless. </p>
<p>Barty sits on the wet floor beside him. Barty cups a hand around the rolled cigarette in his mouth, protecting the lighter in his other hand from the drops of drizzling rain above.  </p>
<p>“I dunno,” Barty says, leaning back on the short wall. “There’s no way to really tell. Maybe our lives will flash before our eyes or some cliche like that.” </p>
<p>“I think that’ll suck. I already went through life once, why should I have to go through it again.” </p>
<p>“Maybe it’ll just be the highlights. The top ten best and worst parts, like a WatchMojo video.”  </p>
<p>“Ugh, the worst parts too?” Regulus grumbles and covers his eyes with his forearm. “Why would you even call it a highlight?” </p>
<p>“Even the bad parts matter. Life only makes sense when you’re looking back on it.” Barty flicks the cigarette ash onto the floor. “Maybe it's the body’s way of saying, ‘hey doesn’t it all make sense now?’” </p>
<p>“Make sense of how much my life sucks,” Regulus snorts. “I don’t need to look back on it to know that.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t have to be that way forever,” Barty shrugs before taking a long drag of the cigarette between his fingers. He tilts his head upwards to the sky and let out the steady stream of smoke above them. “There’s so much life left to live.” </p>
<p>Regulus turns his nose at the smell of nicotine, “It’s going to be a pretty short one with how much you smoke.” </p>
<p>“Let a man have his vices,” Barty tsks and flicks the side of Regulus’ ear. </p>
<p>“You still have to ask yourself the question though.” Barty puts out the cigarette on the railing before lying down on the wet cement beside Regulus. “How do you want to live your life?” </p>
<p>25 years and Regulus was no closer to being a full person. All these years and he’s somehow still the crybaby little brother everyone in his family couldn’t wait to get rid of. Regulus' breath catches in his throat as hot tears prick his eyes. He looks up, hoping that they would get reabsorbed back into his eye balls instead of betraying him. He can barely survive the day to day - charting his life is unfathomable. </p>
<p>He knows Barty won’t judge him. He knows Barty never would. </p>
<p>“You don’t need to figure it out now,” Barty says with softness not many people have the privilege to see. It's scary to fall in love with someone who knows you better than you know yourself. “It’s just good to keep asking yourself that. Keeps you in check.”  </p>
<p>“Okay then,” Regulus says, taking the bait. “How do <em>you </em>want to live?”  </p>
<p>“Enough,” Barty replies, looking up at the clouds above. There is not a single star visible in the sky. “I want to live enough.” </p>
